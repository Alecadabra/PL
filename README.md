Syllabus:

> Programming languages and focuses on the key design issues of various language constructs by analyzing the design choices for these constructs in the context of several commonly used programming languages, and by comparing the design alternatives. The course has four major components. It starts by covering the procedural paradigm and basic compiler design while introducing a fundamental set of programming language design principles. The next two components cover scripting languages as well as the functional, logic paradigms. The final component of the course covers the object oriented paradigm which is currently the most popular programming paradigm.

## [Assignment](Assignment)

A portfolio of small programs, questions and answers based on each week's course
content. Each week I reflect on the language(s) learnt and write a small program
in it and answer a given question. At the end of semester this is all compiled to
form the portfolio to submit as the assignment.

## [Tutorial Worksheets](Tutorial%20Worksheets)

Weekly unasessed tutorial questions to demonstrate that week's course content.
