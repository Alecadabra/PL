# Worksheet 3

## ADA

### 1

*What is the problem with structural equivalence when comparing two data
structures?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 2

*What is name equivalence? Does it have any disadvantages?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 3

*How were the arrays changed in Pascal when compared with Algol60? What was the
reason for the changes?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 4

*In Pascal integers can be assigned to real variables but not vice-versa. What
programming principle does this violate? Would it be a good idea to allow real
numbers to be assigned to integer variables? Why?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 5

*How does the subtype differ from the derived type in Ada?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 6

*Compare the control structures of Pascal and Ada.*

<!-- TODO -->

### 7

*What feature did ADA introduce to eliminate some of the problems associated with
the variable declaration?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 8

*Is ADA more consistent syntactically when compared with Pascal?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 9

*One of the goals of Pascal was security. What changes (if any) would you make to the
language to make it more secure? Justify your answer.*

<!-- TODO -->

### 10

*Compare the syntax of ADA to that of C. Name two improvements you would make
to the C syntax. Justify your answer.*

<!-- TODO -->

### 11

*Which programming principles are violated by the exception handling
implemented in ADA?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 12

*How are exceptions handled in ADA?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 13

*Why does ADA still implement the GOTO statement?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 14

*Is the statement "ADA's parameter passing is more orthogonal when compared with
the parameter passing offered by ALGOL-60, FORTRAN or Pascal", false or true? Justify
your answer.*

<!-- TODO -->

### 15

*Compare and contrast the Pascal programming language with ADA.*

<!-- TODO -->

### 16

*What is a deadlock?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 17

*Is the position-independent parameter feature offered by ADA a good
programming feature? Justify your answer.*

<!-- TODO -->

### 18

*What type of scoping is used for exceptions in ADA?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 19

*What are the advantages of the parameter passing in ADA when compared with
other procedural languages (your answer should discuss the advantages in terms of
the programming principles)?*

<!-- TODO -->

### 20

*Explain why ADA can be regarded as an engineering trade-off.*

<!-- TODO -->

### 21

*Describe the modifications suggested by Wolf and Shaw to address the issues
associated with the block structure.*

<!-- TODO -->

### 22

*Describe how the control structures have evolved over the four generations of
programming languages (your answer should consider the programming principles).*

<!-- TODO -->

### 23

*Is the statement "FORTRAN allows a primitive way to achieve encapsulation", true
or false? Justify your answer.*

<!-- TODO -->
