# Week 2 - Algol and Pascal

## Program

FizzBuzz in Algol 68 up to 100.

Run with `a68g FizzBuzz.a68`

Issue: The program outputs whitespace before printing numbers.

## Testing

Used testing script `TestFizzBuzz.bash`.

Test with `a68g FizzBuzz.a68 | ./TestFizzBuzz.bash`.

The program passes this test.

## Weekly Question

*Assume your program pauses when it prints fizzbuzz. Draw the stack with all
activation records, and both static and dynamic chains, at this point.*
