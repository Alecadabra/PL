# Week 6 - OO Basics and Smalltalk

## Program

FizzBuzz in Smalltalk.

I made mine run from 1 to 100 inclusive as with Fortran and Algol's FizzBuzz.

Run with `./fizzbuzz.st` or `gst fizzbuzz.st`.

## Testing

Used testing script `TestFizzBuzz.bash`.

Test with `./fizzbuzz.st | ./TestFizzBuzz.bash`.

The program passes this test.

## Weekly Question

*How does your implementation of fizz buzz here compare with the
implementations you wrote in Fortran and Algol in terms of readability and
writability?*
