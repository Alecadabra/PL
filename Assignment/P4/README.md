# Week 3 - Yacc/Bison and Lex/Flex

## Program

Yacc/Lex program that accepts a list of numbers eg. `[1, 4, 3]` and outputs
the list in sorted order eg. `[1, 3, 4]`.

Source code located in `sorter.l` and `sorted.y`.

Compile and run with `make run`.

Enter a list using the syntax shown above and a newline, exit with EOF (^D).

All make tasks: `all`, `run`, `clean`.

## Testing

The sorts the list as expected.

## Weekly Question

*If you were building a compiler, how do you think you would implement
a symbol table?*
