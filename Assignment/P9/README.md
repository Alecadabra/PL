# Week 9 - Functional Programming

## Program

Cocktail shaker sort in Scheme.

Source code located in `cocktail_sort.scm`.

Load into the mit-scheme interactive interpreter with
`scheme --load cocktail_sort.scm`.

Use the function `cocktail_sort`, pass it the list to sort, eg.

```scm
]=> (cocktail_sort `(3 1 5 7 3 2))

;Value 13: (1 2 3 3 5 7)
```

Send EOF (`^D`) to exit.

## Testing

Tested with many different lists of varying size and always results in
the same list in sorted order.

## Weekly Question

*Investigate how scheme performs file IO. Does this break regularity? Why or
why not?*
